                <h5>What we expect from you</h5>
                <h6 style="font-style: italic;">Follow these terms and service-specific additional terms</h6>
                <h6>The permission we give you to use our services continues as long as you meet your responsibilities in:
                    <ul>
                        <li>These terms</li>
                        <li>Service-specific additional terms, which could, for example, include things like additional age requirements</li>
                    </ul>

                <h5>About these terms</h5>
                <h6>By law, you have certain rights that can’t be limited by a contract like these terms of service. These terms are in no way intended to restrict those rights.
                </h6>
                <h6>These terms describe the relationship between you and MTP. They don’t create any legal rights for other people or organizations, even if others benefit from that relationship under these terms.</h6>
                <h6>We want to make these terms easy to understand, so we’ve used examples from our services. But not all services mentioned may be available in your country.</h6>
                <h6>If these terms conflict with the service-specific additional terms, the additional terms will govern for that service.</h6>
                <h6>If it turns out that a particular term is not valid or enforceable, this will not affect any other terms.</h6>
                <h6>If you don’t follow these terms or the service-specific additional terms, and we don’t take action right away, that doesn’t mean we’re giving up any rights that we may have, such as taking action in the future.</h6>
                <h6> We may update these terms and service-specific additional terms (1) to reflect changes in our services or how we do business — for example, when we add new services, features, technologies, pricing, or benefits (or remove old ones), (2) for legal, regulatory, or security reasons, or (3) to prevent abuse or harm.</h6>
                <h6> If we materially change these terms or service-specific additional terms, we’ll provide you with reasonable advance notice and the opportunity to review the changes, except (1) when we launch a new service or feature, or (2) in urgent situations, such as preventing ongoing abuse or responding to legal requirements. If you don’t agree to the new terms, you should remove your content and stop using the services. You can also end your relationship with us at any time by closing your FAT Account.</h6>

                <h4 id="cookiesPolicy">Cookies Policy</h4>
                <h6>A cookie is a small piece of text sent to your browser by a website you visit. It helps the website to remember information about your visit, like your preferred language and other settings. That can make your next visit easier and the site more useful to you. Cookies play an important role. Without them, using the web would be a much more frustrating experience.
                    <br>
                    We use cookies for many purposes. We use them, for example, to protect your data.
                </h6>

                <h4 id="dataPolicy">Data Policy</h4>
                <h6>Data are the basis for all sound public health actions and the benefits of data-sharing are widely recognized, including scientific and public health benefits. Whenever possible, MTP wishes to promote the sharing of health data, including but not restricted to surveillance and epidemiological data. The purpose of the policy is to clarify current policy and practice on use and sharing of data collected by MTP. This page summarizes the principles and requirements of the policy.
                </h6>
                <h6>The policy applies to the use and sharing of data collected by MTP, outside the context of public health emergencies. The policy allows, but places no obligation on, MTP to collect, anonymize, analyse or share other health data than those already being collected, anonymized, analysed and shared.</h6>

                <ol>
                    <li>Terms applicable to the provision of data to MTP
                        <br>
                        The text hereto should be included in all data collection forms in all data collection tools (paper-based, electronic or other) used by MTP to collect datA. By providing data to MTP pursuant to these terms, YOU confirm that the data have been collected in accordance with applicable national laws, including data protection laws to protect the confidentiality of identifiable persons.</li>
                    <li>Terms applicable to the use of the data by MTP
                        <br>
                        By providing data to MTP, YOU agree that MTP shall be entitled, subject always to measures to ensure the ethical and secure use of the data, and subject always to an appropriate acknowledgement of the country:
                        <ul>
                            <li>To use and publish the data and make the Data available to any interested party on request on terms that allow non-commercial, not-for-profit use of the Data for public health purposes (provided always that publication of the Data shall remain under the control of MTP);</li>
                            <li>To use, compile, aggregate and analyse the anonymized data and publish the results in conjunction with MTP’s work and in accordance with MTP’s policies and practices.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Measures to ensure the ethical and secure use of data
                        <br>
                        Such measures are required to protect privacy and confidentiality and avoid stigmatization or exclusion of people or communities as a result of data collection. In cases where the compilation, analysis and sharing of aggregated data raise ethical concerns or present risks with regard to confidentiality, MTP will:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Use anonymization and other tools, as appropriate;</li>
                            <li>Comply with informed consent agreements where such consent is needed and respect assurances about ways in which the data (anonymized or otherwise) would be used, shared, stored or protected; and</li>
                            <li>Adopt appropriate security measures to foster public trust.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h6>In addition, any platforms established to share data should have an explicit ethical framework governing data collection and use.</h6>
                    </li>
                    <li> Security of data at MTP
                        <br>
                        Information security at MTP is based on the ISO 27001 standard. MTP has formal and comprehensive information security policies with respective implementation guidelines. Policies cover information security, access to information and systems, cloud computing, application security, information classification and related security standards.</li>
                    <li style="margin-bottom: 60px">Additional safeguards
                        <br>
                        As an additional safeguard to MTP, to individuals, an independent data review committee will be established at MTP to consider, on a case-by-case basis and in consultation with relevant departments in MTP, any instances where the current policy provides inadequate guidance on data-sharing.</li>
